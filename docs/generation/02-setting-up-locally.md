# Setting up FQM Tools

First, clone this repository locally and install its dependencies using Bun (if you do not have Bun installed, [get it here](https://bun.sh/docs/installation)):

```sh
git clone git@github.com:folio-org/fqm-tools.git
cd fqm-tools
bun install
```

To make sure everything is working correctly, we recommend running our test suites:

```sh
bun test
```

As long as you see `0 fail` at the end, all is good!

# Cloning modules

Next, clone the current set of autogenerated modules:

```sh
bun scripts/entity-generation/1-clone-repositories.ts | tee repositories.txt
```

Once this is complete you should see a new folder `external` with `mod-fqm-manager` and all other repositories that support entity type generation. **The output of this command is saved in `repositories.txt`; you will need this list of directories when running the generation steps later.**

Clone your repository into the same folder:

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:folio-org/my-module.git external/my-module
```

Check now that all the modules are present in the `external` folder and that, if your module uses submodules, those are also cloned correctly.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Your module does not necessarily have to go into the `external` folder, but it is recommended to keep all modules in one place for easier management. If you choose to put it elsewhere, make sure to change the path `external/my-module` when running the generation steps later.

# Next steps

Once everything is ready to go locally, check out the next section on [creating an initial configuration](03-creating-a-config.md) to start defining your entity types.
